Initially, kinematic modeling and singularity analysis of the mobile robot is performed. It is found that the singularity can be avoided when the robot has more than two wheels on which two active joints are located. Optimal kinematic parameters of mobile robots with three active joint variables and with four active joint variables are obtained and compared with respect to kinematic isotropic index of the Jacobian matrix of the mobile robot which is functions of the wheel radius and the length of steering link.},

The holonomic motion system is described in terms of mechanical design and electronic control. The paper analyzes the kinematics of the motion system and validates the estimation of the trajectory comparing the displacement estimated with the internal odometry of the motors and the displacement estimated with a SLAM procedure based on LIDAR information. Results obtained in different experiments have shown a difference on less than 30 mm between the position estimated with the SLAM and odometry, and a difference in the angular orientation of the mobile robot lower than 5° in absolute displacements up to 1000 mm.},

	abstract = {Various remote-controlled methods have been developed to improve operability using force or visual assists; however, using only force or visual assists may deteriorate the operability or safety performance. Therefore, a remote-controlled method with both force and visual assists is proposed to improve the operability while maintaining safety performance. The proposed remote-controlled system consists of a wheeled mobile robot, control device, and monitor. The force assist is generated using the time to collision (TTC), which is the predicted time of collision of the mobile robot against an obstacle. This force assist is applied to the operator using a control device to achieve collision avoidance. Using a visual assist, a predicted trajectory for the mobile robot based on the TTC is generated. For operability improvement, this predicted trajectory with color gradation is shown on the monitor. In summary, the achievement of operability improvement while maintaining safety performance is confirmed from experimental results using the proposed method.},
